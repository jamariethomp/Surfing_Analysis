# Oahu Temperatures

## Overview
In order to determine whether the island of Oahu is an ideal location for a surf and ice cream shop, temperatures in summer and winter months must be analyzed. This analysis seeks to determine whether such a business in Oahu is sustainable year-round. 

## Results

- A statistical analysis performed on June temperatures, as shown above, promises a warm, pleasant June with an average temperature of 80°F, highs up to 85°F, and lows down to 64°F. As many people would be expected to take advantage of the perfect surfing conditions, his would make for ideal weather for a surf and ice cream shop.

- The same statistical analysis on December temperatures also indicates what is likely a welcoming climate for surfers, with an average temperature of 71°F. 
- There is a bit more volatility in the month of December; those highs reach a balmy 83°F, lows reach 56°F, a temperature less likely to attact beachgoers. On cooler days such as these, it may be neccesary to close the shop. On the whole, however, the majority of days in December reach a temperature of at least 70°F, making the island an ideal location for an ice cream and surf shop.

## Summary

With the exception of perhaps a few days a year where the surf shop will likely close due to cold temperatures, Oahu appears to be a prime location for a combination surf and ice cream shop due to temperatures rarely dipping below 60°F.

Two additional queries that may be performed on the data might be one based on station location to identify the best locations on Oahu for the shop and another that determines percipitation levels in June and December. SQLAlchemy session queries can be used to run both analyses.
